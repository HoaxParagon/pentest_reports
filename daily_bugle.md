INTRO
This is my mock pentest report on a box hosted on TryHackMe. The box
is called 'Daily Bugle' and is rated as 'Hard'.


Executive Summary
This report presents the results of a test of Daily Bugle's 'black box' 
penetration test. The findings detail n vulnerabilities ranging from informational
to critical.


Details

A scan of the external services reveals 3 open ports.  

Port 80 is running Apache version 2.4.6 and PHP 5.6.40. Apache is currently  
up to date but PHP is far out of date as the current version of PHP is 8.1 (php).

Port 22 shows usage of openSSH version 7.4. which is out of date. The current  
version of openSSH is 9.1. It's recommended that you update OpenSSH.

Port 3306 is running a MariaDB server but no version information.

Gobuster returned several directories and files to investigate. What's noteworthy
here is '/administrator' and 'README.txt'. README.txt shows that the Joomla in use is 
version 3.7. The latest version of Joomla is 4.2.1. It's recommended that you update 
Joomla. In my research I found a github page that offered a python script to exploit 
the SQL injection vulnerability, CVE-2017-8917, present in Joomla 3.7 (github).

I used wget to retrieve the exploit script.

I invoked the exploit script, joomblah.py, with the URL under test.
The script returns usernames and a hash.

The output of the joomblah script is shown below.

I pasted the hash given into a file named hash.txt and used john to crack the hash. The 
wordlist I used was 'rockyou.txt'. The password it cracked is 'spiderman123'.


I tried logging into SSH with jonah and spiderman123 for the username/password but 
was unable to login with these credentials.

The credentials I obtained are valid for the login page hosted at /administrator and
I logged in to the control panel. Research led me to a blog post about gaining a 
reverse shell by editing the templates PHP code to replace the previous code with PHP
reverse shell code. The following screen shots show the process laid out. First, the 
previous code is selected and deleted, then the PHP shell code from pentestmonkey's 
github page is copied over and then parameters are set to reflect the IP address of
the computer you're using. Your IP will be different than mine. Make sure that you 
save the template once the shell code is pasted in. Once the code is setup
I started a listener with netcat on the port I selected, 4444, and activated the shell 
code by visting the site with that template.





The command sudo -l requires a sudo password for user apache. By running that command 
I'm trying to find out what passwordless sudo commands I can run. This is a typical 
method by which to privilege escalate. It's good that you don't allow for passwordless 
sudo commands to be run. This is one of the easiest methods of privilege escalation.


The next step is to check for SUID/SGID binaries that will allow me to run as other 
users. If I can run a binary as root, I can gain an elevated shell pretty easily.
As the screenshot shows, these commands resulted in no SUID/SGID binaries being found.


The next step will be to use a privilege escalation script to search the drive for 
interesting files and folders on the drive. I'm using an automated script to save time 
and to catch everything I may miss while manually enumerating. The first step is to 
download and host the file on my attack machine. The URL for the linpeas release page 
is https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20221016. I downloaded the top
option named 'linpeas.sh' and saved it to my root directory folder. I'm going to copy
 this file to a share folder named 'share' under my root directory on my attack machine
 then share the file using a common python module. The module http.server is meant to host
files on a specified port. Now that I have the file in the ./share folder I can cd to
that directory and share the file for download on my victim machine. You should note
that your IPs will be different than mine.

Now that the linpeas.sh script is saved to the victim machine, I can chmod it to make it
executable and then run it.

The script found a password in a PHP config file. The username 'jjameson' and password 'nv5uz9r3ZEDzVjNu' are valid credentials with which to laterally move. Now logged into 
the user jjameson's account I can cd back to his home directory and there we find the 
flag 'user.txt'.

When I execute sudo -l on this machine I can see that we have access to YUM. I navigated
to https://gtfobins.github.io/ and search for YUM. This site is one that tells me how 
to use binaries to break out and escalate my privileges. By copy/pasting the commands 
shown in red, we can spawn a root shell. Starting at (b) and working through line by 
line, we'll copy and paste each line into our terminal that's logged in as jjameson. In 
the end we have a root shell after invoking sudo yum.
