INTRO
This is my mock pentest report on a box hosted on TryHackMe. The box
is called 'Daily Bugle' and is rated as 'Hard'.


Executive Summary
This report presents the results of a test of Daily Bugle's 'black box' 
penetration test. The findings detail n vulnerabilities ranging from informational
to critical.


Details

A scan of the external services reveals 3 open ports.  

Port 80 is running Apache version 2.4.6 and PHP 5.6.40. Apache is currently  
up to date but PHP is far out of date as the current version of PHP is 8.1 (php).

Port 22 shows usage of openSSH version 7.4. which is out of date. The current  
version of openSSH is 9.1. It's recommended that you update OpenSSH.

Port 3306 is running a MariaDB server but no version information.

Gobuster returned several directories and files to investigate. What's noteworthy
here is '/administrator' and 'README.txt'. README.txt shows that the Joomla in use is 
version 3.7. The latest version of Joomla is 4.2.1. It's recommended that you update 
Joomla. In my research I found a github page that offered a python script to exploit 
the SQL injection vulnerability CVE-2017-8917 (github).
