Intro  
This is a mock pentest report on the room called 'kenobi' on Try Hack Me.  
I believe this room is labeled as 'medium'.  

Executive Summary  
During this 'black box' penetration test I found n vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities range  
from x to y. The out of date software, proftpd, and its exploitation led to remote code  
execution and ultimately I gained full control over this server.  


Vulnerabilities Summary
web facing SAMBA share - high
out of date OpenSSH - med
out of date Proftpd - critical
out of date Apache - med
out of date samba - med
SMB message signing disabled - med

Details  

A port scan revealed 11 open ports. I found an internet facing samba share as well as out of  
date softwares. The out of date softwares include proftpd, openSSH, SAMBA and Apache.

Remediation for out of date software is to implement an update plan and carry that out in your  
environment.  


SMB message signing is also disabled by default. This is insecure by default and you'll need  
to fix this issue to avoid possible man in the middle attacks where a threat actor will sit in  
the middle of two connections to intercept traffic (beyond security). Remediation is to  
enable SMB message signing.
