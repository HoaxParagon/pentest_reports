   I initiated a basic scan of the open ports on 10.10.59.235 and found
11 of them. I started investigating the http servers found on port 80
and port 8080 first.

   Port 80 presented me with a photo of a gentleman. I checked the source code 
of the site by pressing F12 but couldn't find anything exploitable there. It
should be noted that the site itself is insecure due to a missing cert.
Any information transmitted by the customer will be readable in plain text.
Fixing this issue would involve adding a publically signed certificate to 
the webserver. I found the same issue on the service hosted on port 8080 as
well.

   I checked the service on port 8080 next which presented me with the following
screen.

The server version info is notable because when I hover over it, it links to
rejetto[.]com/hfs. I tried to inject both CSS and PHP code into the search box but
neither worked.

I searched through searchsploit for 'rejetto' to find any possible vulnerabilities
or exploits listed and I found 6 possible scripts to exploit the version of the 
service hosted on port 8080. The latest version is listed as 2.3m and as 
this server application hasn't been updated in quites some time, it's recommended
to switch to something more recent and that gets updates regularly to avoid
attackers getting in easily.
