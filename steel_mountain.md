   During this test I found one informational and one critical vulnerabilities. Remediation 
for the critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is going to be complicated and involves 
replacing the outdated software with software that gets regular updates because the software currently 
installed, Rejetto, is no longer supported. Remediation for the informational vulnerability is 
relatively simple and would improve user interaction with the site by reducing the errors the user sees 
when visiting your website.
   
   
   I initiated a basic scan of the open ports on 10.10.59.235 and found
11 of them. I started investigating the http servers found on port 80
and port 8080 first.

   Port 80 presented me with a photo of a gentleman. I checked the source code 
of the site by pressing F12 but couldn't find anything exploitable there. It
should be noted that the site itself is insecure due to a missing certification. This is an
informational finding. Obtaining a valid certification will reduce the errors the user sees,
and improve the overall security for the user when typing information into your website.
Any information transmitted by the customer will be readable in plain text.
Fixing this issue would involve adding a publically signed certificate to 
the webserver. I found the same issue on the service hosted on port 8080 as
well.

   I checked the service on port 8080 next which presented me with the following
screen.
![server version info](/screenshots/steel-mountain/8080_server_version_info.png)  

The server version info is notable because when I hover over it, it links to
rejetto[.]com/hfs. I tried to inject both CSS and PHP code into the search box but
neither worked.

I searched through searchsploit for 'rejetto' to find any possible vulnerabilities
or exploits listed and I found 6 possible scripts to exploit the version of the 
service hosted on port 8080. The latest version is listed as 2.3m and as 
this server application hasn't been updated in quites some time, it's recommended
to switch to something more recent and that gets updates regularly to avoid
attackers getting in easily. The exploits listed include remote code execution 
vulnerabilities. The attacker could easily gain access and control the server.

I also checked metasploit for any exploit modules listed and I found only 1 but
it's ranked as 'excellent'. I will use this exploit to gain a foothold in the 
system.  

![msf exploit](/screenshots/steel-mountain/msf_exploit_results.png)  

First, I select the exploit for use.

![use exploit](/screenshots/steel-mountain/use_exploit.png)  

Next, I set the relevant options such as rhosts and rport because the default 
port that's set to be used is 80 and the vulnerability is on port 8080. The
payload option of meterpreter is fine for this.

![set options](/screenshots/steel-mountain/set_options.png)  

With the options set, it's time for a final check before executing the exploit.

![check options](/screenshots/steel-mountain/check_options.png)  

Both rports and rhosts look correct, time to run the exploit.
With the exploit run, we can see that the reverse shell was created successfully.
After using meterpreter to run the 'shell' command, I'm given access to Bill's 
account, as shown by the 'whoami' command.

![success](/screenshots/steel-mountain/exploit_success.png)  

Now it's time to attempt privilege escalation to get administrative access. I do this by uploading a script called PowerShell[.]ps1. This is a scanning script 
meant to find the cracks in the operating system. I do this first by backgrounding
 the shell with 'CTRL+z'. Now that I'm back in meterpreter, I can upload the file by first downloading it from hxxps://github[.]com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit. The exact script used can be found in the 
 'Privesc' folder. With this script stored locally on my machine, it's time to
 upload it to the server.

I then activated a new shell and changed directory to where the powershell script
was located. 

![running script](/screenshots/steel-mountain/about_to_run_script.png)  

Now I import the script and run the checks.
